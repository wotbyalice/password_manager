## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT (Requires Testing)**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Node.js** 18.0.0 or higher ([Download here](https://nodejs.org))
- **Windows** 10/11 (primary target)
- **4GB RAM** minimum (8GB recommended)

### **Option 1: Automated Setup (Untested)**
1. **Double-click** `deploy.bat` in the Password_Manager folder
2. **Wait** for automatic setup (installs dependencies, sets up database, runs tests)
3. **Access** the application at `http://localhost:3001` (if successful)
4. **Login** with `admin@company.com` / `admin123` (if working)

### **Option 2: Manual Setup**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup database
npm run setup:db

# Test deployment
npm run test:deployment

# Start server
node src/server/server.js
```

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**

**This project contains a complete codebase but has NOT been fully tested in a working environment. Before production use:**

1. **Verify Node.js installation and npm functionality**
2. **Test database connectivity (currently using SQLite fallback)**
3. **Verify all dependencies install correctly**
4. **Test authentication and user management**
5. **Verify real-time features work as expected**
6. **Test Electron desktop application**
7. **Validate security features and encryption**

## 📋 **WHAT'S IMPLEMENTED (Code Complete)**

✅ **Complete file structure** with proper organization
✅ **Express.js server** with API routes and middleware
✅ **Electron desktop application** framework
✅ **Authentication system** with JWT and bcrypt
✅ **Password management** CRUD operations
✅ **Real-time features** with Socket.io
✅ **Database abstraction** (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
✅ **Security middleware** and encryption
✅ **Comprehensive configuration** files
✅ **Test files** (Jest framework)
✅ **Build scripts** for Windows installer
✅ **Deployment automation** scripts

## ❓ **WHAT NEEDS VERIFICATION**

⚠️ **Actual functionality** - Does the application start and run?
⚠️ **Database connectivity** - Does it connect to any database?
⚠️ **User authentication** - Does login/logout work?
⚠️ **Password operations** - Can users add/edit/delete passwords?
⚠️ **Real-time sync** - Do updates appear across clients?
⚠️ **Electron app** - Does the desktop application launch?
⚠️ **Security features** - Is encryption working correctly?
⚠️ **Test suite** - Do the automated tests pass?

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
# Start server and Electron app
npm run dev

# Or start separately:
npm run server    # Start backend server
npm start         # Start Electron app
```

### 4. First Login

- **Email**: `admin@yourcompany.com` (or your configured admin email)
- **Password**: `ChangeThisPassword123!` (change this immediately!)
